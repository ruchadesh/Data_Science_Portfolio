The aim of this project is to analyze products and services of a particular business that people are talking about on Yelp.
Building a model, which can provide meaningful insights to the business and help it to improve the products/services,can be of significant.
In this work, We identified some potential strengths and weaknesses of businesses on Yelp. For example, Figure 1 shows an example 
of some bad/average features that should be considered for better customers' satisfication. Ultimately, such features can contribute 
to improve the overall quality of products/service offered by businesses.
