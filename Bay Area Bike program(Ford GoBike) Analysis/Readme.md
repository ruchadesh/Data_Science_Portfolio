# Business Case :    

To analyze the performance of a bike sharing program klaunch by Ford in San Francisco city. 
# Objective:                 

To Analyze the bike usage across customer types , find out possible opportunities and provide recommendations to improvise the program performance


## What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The data consistts of monthwise information regarding bike rides made by users over year 2018.
After combining all the input files, merged dataset has ~1.7 million bike rides and their features such as :
(Each trip is anonymized)
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
- Member Year of Birth
- Member Gender
The dataset can be found at https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data
## Summary of Findings
- For all types of users, maximum number of rides happened for 10 -11 minutes
- For all users, We can see a gradual increase in bike rides over the months from the starting of the year.
It reached maximum value in October and dropped suddenly in November and December
This sudden drop could be because of the Holiday season or winter.
- Also, sudden increase was observed from month of April to May. This could be because users like to
use bikes more in Summer season as compared to winter
- All users have used bikes maximum number of times on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (which are
prime weekdays). I observed that usage suddenly dropped on weekends. So people mostly make use of
these rides for their commute to work/or during lunch hour.
- Out of ~1.7 million rides in a year, subscribers contributed to 89% rides and customers contributed to
11% rides
- Out of all users, Male users seem to make maximum use of rides (73.5%) as compared to female
users(25%) and others( 1.5%)
- Irrespective of a gender, bike user's mean age is in the range of 30-35 years.
- I observed that usual customers have not shared a bike ride at alldurign their rides and contribute upto
12% of total users who have not shared a ride
- Bike ride usage by usual customers is quite similar over days of the week. where interestingly,
subscribers show maximum usage on weekdays as compared to weekends
## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation I have focused on all the findings I have about the bike ride usage across the types
of users.
My presentation also shows the difference between ride usage across genders and also at different
times ( months, weekdays, weekends)
