# **Academic Data Science Projects**
These are some of the data science projects I got the opportunity to work on during my Masters course. I worked on this projects using R Studio and Python. 

## [Employee Churn Prediction (HR Analytics)](https://github.com/ruchadesh/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Employee_Churn_Prediction):

- People analytics can help to assess the effectiveness of people practices, programs, and processes. 
  This project has helped me understand how knowledge of social and data sciences can help you make 
  more informed, objective people decisions.

- HR Analytics includes the application of analytical processes to the Human Resources department of 
  an organization in order to increase the employee performance and get a better return on investment.
