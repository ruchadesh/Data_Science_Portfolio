# **Academic Data Science Projects**
These are some of the data science projects I got the opportunity to work on during my Masters course. I worked on this projects using R Studio and Python. 

## [Employee Churn Prediction (HR Analytics)](https://github.com/ruchadesh/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Employee_Churn_Prediction):

- People analytics can help to assess the effectiveness of people practices, programs, and processes. 
  This project has helped me understand how knowledge of social and data sciences can help you make 
  more informed, objective people decisions.

- HR Analytics includes the application of analytical processes to the Human Resources department of 
  an organization in order to increase the employee performance and get a better return on investment. 
  
## [Health Insurance MarketPlace Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/ruchadesh/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Health%20Insurance%20Marketplace%20Analysis%20and%20Prediction):

- Health Insurance is a program that covers medical expenses through private/ social or social welfare program . Health Insurance has   
  started declining since 2000. Due to unemployment and rise in insurance cost, the rates of coverage have declined significantly. 
  A rise is observed in public insurance since the pool of people with private health insurance has shrunk.
  
- This projectc helps the customers to select a suitable metal plan category according to their needs. 

## [Kaggle competition- Titanic Survival]
(https://github.com/ruchadesh/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Titanic_Survival) :

- The wreck of the RMS Titanic was one of the worst shipwrecks in history, and is certainly the most well-known.  On April 15, 1912,     during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This   
  sensational tragedy shocked the international community and lead to better safety regulations for ships.
 
- One of the reasons that the shipwreck lead to such loss of life is that were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.         Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than       others, like women, children, and the upper-class.

- This contest code includes the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
